## 📊 Sample Data

## 🔐 Security Notes

**For Production Deployment:**

1. Change `SECRET_KEY` in settings.py
2. Set `DEBUG = False`
3. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
4. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
5. Set up proper static file serving (WhiteNoise or CDN)
6. Configure HTTPS
7. Set up proper media file storage (AWS S3, etc.)
8. Enable CSRF protection
9. Configure secure cookies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Static files not loading:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Database issues:
```bash
# Reset database
rm db.sqlite3
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Re-run sample data script
```

### Port already in use:
```bash
# Use a different port
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

## 🎓 Key Django Concepts Used

1. **Models:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database
2. **Views:** 
   - Class-based views (ListView, DetailView)
   - Function-based views for forms
3. **Templates:** 
   - Template inheritance (extends)
   - Template tags ({% url %}, {% static %})
   - Template filters (|date, |truncatewords)
4. **Forms:** Django's form handling and CSRF protection
5. **Admin:** Customized admin interface
6. **Static Files:** CSS, JavaScript, images
7. **Media Files:** User-uploaded content
8. **URL Routing:** Clean, semantic URLs

## 💡 Tips

- Use Django shell for data manipulation: `python manage.py shell`
- Create database backups regularly
- Use Django Debug Toolbar for development (already in requirements)
- Write tests for your views and models
- Use Django's built-in pagination
- Leverage Django's ORM instead of raw SQL
